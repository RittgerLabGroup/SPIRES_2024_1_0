0,Order by which the filtering is processed. Important for thresholding by snow_fraction. This column should stay in 2nd position (to be sorted in EspEnv instanciation). (The id of the threshold group should stay in 1st position).,Indicate where the group is used,Only used for stcStruct,Variable upon which the thresholds should be performed,,,Variable set to not reliable value when the threshold is applied.,Comment line.
